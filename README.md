# Data-Cleaning-and-Exploration-in-SQL
In this project, I work with a dataset about company layoffs. The purpose of this project is to learn and familiarize myself with SQL queries. There are 2 parts to this project, data cleaning and exploration analysis. MySQL was used to complete this project.

In the data cleaning section, I focus on removing duplicates, standardizing the data, removing null values, and removing any unessecary columns. In the explaration analysis, I focus on understanding trends and visualizations of the data.
